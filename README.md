# The Self-Taught Programmer Challenges

This repository contains my practice work based on what I learned from reading the book "The Self-Taught Programmer" by Cory Althoff.

As I progress through each chapter, I will add my solutions to the challenges presented in the book. While these solutions may vary from the exact challenges, they reflect the concepts I've learned, applied to different scenarios. I am using C# for all the solutions in this repository.
